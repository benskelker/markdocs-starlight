This topic describes how 
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_full %}
enables end users, such as those in DevOps and Cloud Engineering, to
natively and securely access the cloud management layer.

## The {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_full %} solution

{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_full %}
provisions just-in-time privileged access for administrative operations
in multi-cloud environments, using the principle of least-privilege
access.
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}
enables operational efficiencies for IAM and Security teams implementing
Zero Trust. This improves security posture by removing unnecessary
standing access.

Additionally, all sessions are simultaneously protected and monitored
for audit and compliance.

## How does it work?

1.  End users that need access to the cloud management layer connect to
    their cloud environments via web console or CLI.

2.  The end users natively authenticate using either
    {% $cc_product_vars.Identity_full %}
    or another third-party IdP.

3.  In the background,
    {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}
    validates approved entitlements for an end user's session. The end
    users then select the scope of their current task, ensuring least
    privilege access.

4.  Access for cloud management operations is elevated just-in-time to
    reduce the risk of compromised credentials. Sessions are time-bound
    and permissions are revoked automatically at the end of a session.

5.  Web-based sessions to the cloud console are recorded for audit and
    compliance. Additional session protection helps reduce the risk of
    browser hijacking.

6.  Cloud security and
    {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}
    administrators can trigger an on-demand sync from within
    {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}.
    This supports the dynamic nature of the cloud environment and
    ensures the most up-to-date information about roles and workspaces
    is available when managing access policies for end users.

## {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} architecture

The
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}
solution utilizes several business and shared services in the
{% $cc_product_vars.ISP_short %}.
The
{% $cc_product_vars.shared_services_full %}
provide basic functions like user management, SSOÂ and MFA, and system
auditing. Other business services work together with
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %}
to provide a complete solution for managing access to your
organizational cloud services with zero standing permissions.

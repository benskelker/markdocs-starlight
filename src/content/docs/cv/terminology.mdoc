## Frontmatter fields
You create frontmatter at the top of the file, before any of the file's text content. Its structure is a gated YAML object:

```yml title="Frontmatter"
<!-- Frontmatter -->
---
title: Terminology
custom:
  name: custom
  desc: sustom object for creating local vars
  type: string or object; when object all children must be strings
---

<!-- Your Markdown text goes here -->
# Page title

Some text...
```

Fields in the frontmatter can be used in the file as Markdoc variables, like this:  
`{% $frontmatter.<variable-name> %}`.

The frontmatter accepts these fields:
* `title`: the page's title, used as for browser's tab name and metadata
  {% aside type="tip" %}
  If you do not specify a first-level header (`#`) in the file, the `title` field is used to populate its value.
  {% /aside %}
* `description`: a high-level page description, also used for metadata
* `custom`: used to create custom Markdoc variables that can be used in the file:
  * accepts a string or object
  * the object's fields must be strings

### Example custom field

To create a a `custom` object, add this as your file's frontmatter:

```yml
---
custom:
  name: Liverpool
  position: first
---
```

You can then used the variable's values anywhere in the file. For example:  
`{% $frontmatter.custom.name %} came {% $frontmatter.custom.position %} in the league.`

Renders:

{% $frontmatter.custom.name %} came {% $frontmatter.custom.position %} in the league.

You can also use the variable to add conditional text to the file:

```
{% if equals($frontmatter.custom.position, "first") %}
This team came first: {% $frontmatter.custom.name %}
{% /if %}
```
Which renders:  
{% if equals($frontmatter.custom.position, "first") %}
This team came first: {% $frontmatter.custom.name %}
{% /if %}

## CyberArk cloud platform terminology

This topics explains CyberArk cloud platform terminology related to
connecting to your cloud environments:

{% table %}
- Term {% width="16%" %}
- Description
---
- **Platform**
- Any cloud provider. CyberArk cloud security supports the following cloud providers:
  * AWS
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Google Cloud
---
- **Workspace**
- A workspace is a generic term to represent a subdivision of a cloud platform. A workspace is where cloud entities operate on cloud resources using granted       permissions.\
  {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} supports the following workspaces:\
  **AWS**:

  * Standalone AWS account
  * AWS organization (multiple AWS accounts without IAM Identity Center)
  * AWS organization (multiple AWS accounts with IAM Identity Center)

  **Microsoft Azure**:

  * {% $cv_shared_variables.entra_id_long %} directory
  * Management group
  * Subscription

  **Google Cloud**:

  * Google Cloud organization
  * Google Cloud project
---
- **CyberArk tenant**
- Your organization's isolated instance on CyberArk's Identity Security Platform.
---
- **onboard vs connect** {% #onboard_vs_connect %}
- To secure your cloud environment, you need to first **onboard** the cloud environment to CyberArk. During the onboarding, {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} searches across the workspace to **discover the structure** of the workspace. See [discover vs scan](#discover_vs_scan) below.\
  {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} also offers identity and entitlement analysis capabilities. To use these capabilities, {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} must be **connected** to the onboarded workspace. {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  can then scan the discovered workspace for the purpose of this analysis.
---
- **discover vs scan** {% #discover_vs_scan %}
- **Discovery** - When {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} onboards a workspace, it **performs a discovery**, meaning that it scans across the workspace **to discover the structure of the workspace**.
  After the initial discovery, **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  performs a scheduled discovery across the workspace every 24 hours** to detect any changes to its structure.\
  For example, say you onboard a full {% $cv_shared_variables.entra_id_long %} directory. During the onboarding, {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  performs an initial discovery of the whole directory structure. It will also discover the management groups, and subscriptions within the directory. The entire directory is reflected in {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  on the **Settings > Platform management > Azure** page.\
  The scheduled 24-hourly discovery picks up changes to the directory structure such as new subscriptions, removed management groups, and so on, after which these updates are reflected in the directory structure in {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}.

  {% if equals($variant, "oss") %}
  **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan**:  Whereas **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} discovery** scans the workspace to **discover the structure** of the workspace, the **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan** scans the workspace for **informational updates for the purpose of identity and entitlement analysis**.\
  You have to trigger **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scans** manually from the relevant workspace page in {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} (**Settings > Platform management**). For more information, see Connect and manage workspaces.

  {% aside %}
  To perform a **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan**, the workspace must be **onboarded** and {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} must be **connected** to the workspace. See [onboard vs connect](#onboard_vs_connect) above.
  {% /aside %}
  {% /if %}

  {% if equals($variant, "ent") %}
  **Scan** - Both {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  and {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_full %} **scan** discovered workspaces, but each for a different purpose.

  * **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan**: Whereas **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} discovery** scans the workspace to **discover the structure** of the workspace, the **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan** scans the workspace for **informational updates for the purpose of identity and entitlement analysis**.\
    You have to trigger **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scans** manually from the relevant workspace page in {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} (**Settings > Platform management**). For more information, see the {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} docs.

    {% aside %}
    To perform a **{% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} scan**, the workspace must be **onboarded** and {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %} must be **connected** to the workspace. See [onboard vs connect](#onboard_vs_connect) above.
    {% /aside %}

  * **{% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} scan**: {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} scans discovered workspace for roles, permission sets, and resources. The initial {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} **scan** is performed automatically immediately upon initial discovery of the workspace. After that, {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} performs scheduled scans twice a day (every 12 hours) to detect any updates to roles and resources.
    In addition, when creating an access policy, you can trigger a scan manually from the {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} policy creation wizard or by running the Scan API.

    {% aside %}
    For {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} to scan the workspace, the workspace must be **onboarded and discovered**, but {% $cc_product_vars.CV_full %}  doesn't have to be connected to the workspace. This is true for all {% $cc_product_vars.SCA_short %} functionality.

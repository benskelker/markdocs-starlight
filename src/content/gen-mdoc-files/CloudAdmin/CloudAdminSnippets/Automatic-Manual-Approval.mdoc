method]{.Emphasis} tab and select an approval method:

- [Manual]{.Emphasis}: Approvals will be directed through your approval
  channel, except for any exceptions you choose to define, which will be
  approved manually.

- [Automatic]{.Emphasis}: Approvals will be automatic, other than
  exceptions that will be directed through your approval channel.

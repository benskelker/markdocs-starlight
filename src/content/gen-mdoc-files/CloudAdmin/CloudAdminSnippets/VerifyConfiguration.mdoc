When you finish all of the configuration tasks, we strongly recommend
testing the complete on-demand access flow outside of
{% $cc_product_vars.Flows-short %}
to verify that the following happens correctly:

- The access request arrives via the configured approval channel

- The user receives an approval email after you approve the request

- The user receives a rejection email after you deny the request

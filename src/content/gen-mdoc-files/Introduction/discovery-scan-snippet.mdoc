If you see additional workspaces in
{% $cc_product_vars.CV-full %}
that are not reflected in
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA-full %},
you can trigger an
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA-short %}
scan from the user interface or from the API to reflect the additional
workspaces and their resources/roles in
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA-short %}.

If you have an Azure P1 or P2 license for Entra ID (formerly called
Azure Active Directory or Azure AD), you should also add the following
{% $cc_product_vars.SCA-short %}
flag to the onboarding script. This flag will create the
{% $cc_C_CyberArk.CompanyName %}{% cc_product_vars.SCA-short %}
Cloud Application Administer role, which is a least-privileged Entra ID
role:

::: code
                        --sca-least-privileged-mode
                    
:::

</li>

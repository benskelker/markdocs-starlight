## Select the cloud roles {#select-the-cloud-roles .step madcap:autonum="Step 3: "}

In this step, you choose the cloud roles you want to include in the
policy . You can filter by package to help limit the number of cloud
roles you see in the table.

1.  From the list on the left, select a Google Cloud resource:
    organization, folder, or project.

2.  In the list of roles, select the roles you want to include in the
    policy:

    - To inspect the permissions in a role, select [More
      actions]{.Emphasis} (![](../images/icon_ellipsis-v.png){.icon}) \>
      [Role details]{.Emphasis}.

    - Mark the check boxes for the cloud roles you want to include in
      this policy and click [Select]{.Emphasis}.

      ::: note
      To enforce least privilege and reduce your risk exposure, you
      should use only predefined or custom roles in your production
      environment.

## Define the access rules {#define-the-access-rules .step madcap:autonum="Step 4: "}

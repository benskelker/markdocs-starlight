        <h3>Wiz-CyberArk Integration</h3>
        <p>The new integration between Wiz and CyberArk enhances cloud security by identifying identities with excessive access and automatically migrating them to a Zero Standing Privileges setup. This strengthens security while maintaining compliance in dynamic cloud environments.</p>
        <p>Wiz detects identities with excessive access, and CyberArk enforces privilege controls—either automatically or via Wiz Rules.</p>
        <p>You can find the Wiz-<MadCap:variable name="cc_C_CyberArk.CompanyName" /> integration in the <a href="https://community.cyberark.com/marketplace/s/#a35Ht0000018sACIAY-a39Ht000004GLSJIA4]">CyberArk Marketplace</a> </p>

        <p>We’ve enhanced policy creation and management by introducing exact match functionality for cloud role searches.  To improve search accuracy, enclose your search term in double quotes (" "). </p>
        <p>For example, if there are two roles named <span class="Emphasis">Contributor</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Automation Contributor</span>, searching for <span class="Emphasis">"Contributor"</span> (with quotes around Contributor) will return only the exact match, <span class="Emphasis">Contributor</span>.</p>

        <h3>Integration with <MadCap:variable name="cc_C_CyberArk.CompanyName" /><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short" /></h3>
        <p>Third-party vendors often need access to cloud services so they can perform maintenance and support activities. This type of privileged access can now be protected by <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />. Using the new integration between <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short" /> and <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />, organizations can manage vendor access to their cloud services and apply zero standing privileges.</p>
        <p>Currently, the <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short" /> integration with <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> is available for AWS only.</p>
        <h3>Sync cloud workspaces and permissions on demand</h3>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="cc_C_CyberArk.CompanyName" /> triggers an automatic sync of your cloud workspaces and cloud IAM roles to <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> every 12 hours. Cloud workspaces are synced against <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.CEM-full" /> while cloud IAM roles are synced against the relevant cloud provider.</p>
        <p>To support the dynamic nature of the cloud environment, you can now trigger an on-demand sync to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information about roles and workspaces when creating access policies.</p>
        <h2>August 7, 2023</h2>
        <h3>Integration with third-party IdPs for all cloud providers</h3>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> can be integrated with third-party IdPs for AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Customers can continue using their existing IdP and leverage <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />'s ability to enforce zero standing privileges to the cloud management console. </p>
        <h3>On-demand access enhancements</h3>
        <h4>Allowed identities</h4>
        <p>Cloud management is a sensitive resource because it allows access to all of your cloud services. As such, user access should be limited to those identities that are authorized administrators of the workspaces they want to access. With the new allowed identities feature, organizations can allow only certain identities to request access or elevated permissions to cloud management consoles.</p>
        <h4>Context-aware automatic approval</h4>
        <p>Additionally, as part of the on-demand access workflow organizations can now define the default approval method, either automatic or manual. Along with the default approval method,  exceptions can be defined for identities that meet certain conditions.</p>
        <p>For example, an organization can define the default approval method as manual, meaning all on-demand access requests must be handled by an administrator. However, if an identity submits a request to access a workspace tagged as "staging", this poses little to no risk so the request can be approved automatically.</p>
        <p>Using this new capability, organizations can enforce security guidelines while reducing the workload for approvers, enabling them to handle only higher-risk access requests.</p>
        <h4>Approval channel enhancements</h4>
        <p>In addition to an out-of-the-box approval flow for Slack, organizations can now create custom approval flows in <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.Flows-short" /> and apply them in <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />. This allows tailoring the approval channel work flow to better suit organizational needs.</p>
        <h2>May 7, 2023</h2>
        <h3>On-demand access for end-users</h3>
        <p>Organizations have assorted personas with different access needs. For example, developers require daily access to perform development and maintenance tasks, while SRE users may occasionally need access to a production environment to troubleshoot a production issue.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> now provides a solution for both needs. Organizations can benefit from regular policy-based access for daily users, and on-demand access for unplanned or infrequent situations that require immediate attention for a critical issue. On-demand access enables users to request access to specific workspaces at specific times. With this new capability, organizations can further reduce exposure due to excessive privileges and grant elevated permissions only when actually required.</p>
        <p>On-demand access comes with an out-of-the-box integration with Slack, and can be customized for other ChatOps channels or ticketing systems.</p>
        <h3>Support for Azure AD</h3>
        <p>Azure AD includes highly privileged roles such as Global Administrator. To keep cloud environments secure, organizations need a way to assign these roles on a Just-In-Time basis for sessions that are limited in length.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> introduces Just-In-Time access and privilege elevation for Microsoft Azure AD roles. This capability helps organizations improve their security posture and reduce risk by granting least-privilege, on-demand access to Azure AD roles for daily operations using <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> policies. Using <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />, cloud security administrators can grant Just-In-Time access to Azure AD roles at the tenant level. Users can access their Azure cloud environment from either the Azure management portal or the Azure CLI.</p>
        <p>With this new enhancement, <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> now fully supports Microsoft Azure, with both Azure AD and Azure RBAC functionality.</p>

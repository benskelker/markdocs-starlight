# free trial

Welcome to the () free trial.\

The free trial offers a guided experience to help you onboard workspaces
in your cloud environment to .

During the trial, you can explore key features, such as defining secure
cloud access policies for current and new users. Users can explore
connecting to your cloud environments based on their assigned roles.
After completing the onboarding process, you'll have access to
additional features, including configuring session recording, connecting
to a third-party IdP, and setting up request approval channels.

## Supported cloud workspaces

supports:

- and

- organizations and projects

## Before you begin

Here are some notes before you start with the free trial.

### Prerequisites

- [ user roles]{.Emphasis} - In your CyberArk SCA free trial tenant, you
  are given the necessary administrative roles and access to the space
  and services that you will be working with during your free trial
  period.

  The following roles are provided:

    Role                                Description
    ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [Global Auditor]{.Emphasis}         Gives global auditing access to the [Audit service](/audit/latest/en/content/resources/_topnav/cc_home.htm){alt="Link to the Audit documentation in the docs portal"} for monitoring system activity by event

- [Web browser pop-up blocker]{.Emphasis} - Allow the tenant URL
  (\*.id.cyberark.cloud) in your browser\'s pop-up blocker settings.

- [External links]{.Emphasis} - Links from the platform UI to external
  URLs may behave unexpectedly, usually due to a URL protection or
  pop-up blocker software that you are working with. If you experience
  this during the trial, add the relevant URLs to the allowed or trusted
  sites in your URL protection or pop-up blocker software.

[Prerequisite:]{.Emphasis} Make sure you have an Azure user whose prefix
is identical to your tenant user.

If you don\'t have such a user in Azure, create one now using the same
prefix as your tenant user, as follows: [\<user prefix in
identity\>@azuredomain]{.Emphasis}.

For example, if your tenant user is
[demo-user]{.Emphasis}\@11111.cyberark.cloud, and then create a Azure
user as follows: [demo-user]{.Emphasis}\@acme.com, where
[acme.com]{.Emphasis} is your Azure domain.

::: ProcedureHeading
[Map your CyberArk tenant user to your Azure user:]{.Emphasis}
:::

1.  From the Administration spacel navigator, select .

2.  In the left navigation, under [Apps & Widgets]{.Emphasis}, select
    [Web Apps]{.Emphasis}.

3.  Open the Azure web app that you created in Configure one-click user
    access.

4.  In the [Account mapping]{.Emphasis} tab, select [Account Mapping
    Script]{.Emphasis} and enter the script
    ([case-sensitive]{.Emphasis}) as follows, replacing
    [azuredomain]{.Emphasis} with your organization\'s Azure domain:

    ::: code
        LoginUser.Username= LoginUser.Shortname + "@azuredomain";
    :::

    For example, if your Azure user name is [eva@acme.com]{.Emphasis},
    then your Azure domain is [acme.com]{.Emphasis}. In the script,
    replace `azuredomain` with [acme.com]{.Emphasis}:

    ::: example

### Validate your onboarding {#validate-your-onboarding .step madcap:autonum="Step 4: "}

On the space home page, click [Done? Validate now]{.Emphasis}.

The validation window opens and displays the validation results. If
there are any issues, follow the instructions in the validation error
messages. When you are done, click [Revalidate]{.Emphasis}.

## Connect to your cloud environment with zero standing privileges (ZSP)

Once you have onboarded your workspace to , you grant users ZSP to the
workspace.

To achieve this, you create access policies that specify the roles a
user can have in your cloud environment, along with when and for how
long they can access these roles. This approach enforces zero-standing
access to your organization\'s cloud resources while ensuring users get
the access they need, only when they need it.

### Grant zero standing privileges (ZSP) {#grant-zero-standing-privileges-zsp .stepReset madcap:autonum="Step 1: "}

::: ProcedureHeading
To create a policy:
:::

On the space home page, under the [Guided flows]{.Emphasis} area, go to
[Explore]{.Emphasis} \> [Grant zero standing privileges]{.Emphasis} and
follow the guided steps.

environment.

::: ProcedureHeading
To connect to the cloud environment:
:::

On the space home page, in the [Guided flows]{.Emphasis} area, under
[Explore]{.Emphasis}, click [Experience zero standing
privileges]{.Emphasis} and follow the guided steps.

As long as there is a policy set up giving you access at the current
time, you will be able to connect.

If you aren\'t able to connect, you can send an access request.

On the space home page, in the [Guided flows]{.Emphasis} area, under
[Explore]{.Emphasis}, click [Request on-demand access]{.Emphasis} and
follow the guided steps.

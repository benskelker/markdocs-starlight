        <h1><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-full" /> with Wiz</h1>
        <p>CyberArk and Wiz provide an integration that enables you to easily detect identities with excessive standing privileges, whether identities, users, or groups, and automate the implementation of zero standing privileges for those identities across multi-cloud environments. </p>
        <p>Wiz provides an agentless platform for securing cloud environments by identifying and prioritizing risks such as misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and compliance violations across multi-cloud setups. It enables you to see how secure your cloud environment is at any given moment, and helps you streamline remediation with a unified, intuitive dashboard.</p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Visibility across all identities </span> - Wiz provides deep visibility into cloud environments, enabling you to gain comprehensive insights into all privileged identities with cloud access. This feature helps you identify and monitor all users, applications, and services with privileged access. By using CyberArk's intelligent privilege controls, you can secure this access effectively.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Seamless Remediation:</span> Wiz’s remediation framework enables you to address security risks efficiently. By applying CyberArk’s privilege controls to identities with risky access privileges, you can promptly detect and mitigate these risks. This approach helps reinforce your organization's overall security posture without disrupting operational efficiency.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Comprehensive Reporting:</span> By combining Wiz’s visibility with CyberArk’s privilege control insights, you can generate detailed reports on your security posture. This integration provides clear and actionable intelligence, helping you understand which identities' access privileges are protected and which are not, thereby enhancing identity security.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supported cloud providers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Microsoft Azure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Amazon Web Services</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/integrations/wiz-sca-diagram.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The integration enables you to remedy excessive standing access issues for users and groups. You can initiate this remediation process either manually or by using Wiz automation rules. Once this process is triggered, Wiz executes a preconfigured flow in CyberArk Identity Flows.</p>
        <p>The flow consists of the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Verify the identity:</span> Check if the identity for which Wiz found excessive standing access exists in your identity provider (IdP).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Check existing policies:</span> Determine if a <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-full" /> (<MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" />) policy is already in place for this identity and its corresponding entitlements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Create a new policy:</span> If no relevant policy exists, create a new <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.SCA-short" /> policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Update the Wiz issue:</span> Add a comment to the Wiz issue to notify the administrator about the policy creation and recommend the removal of excessive standing access.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Azure:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wiz supports users and groups with Azure roles. Wiz doesn't support users and groups with Entra ID roles.</li>
                    <li>
				Wiz supports only identities, users, and groups that are detected by Wiz and validated in your IdP. Access provisioning via an IdP role is not supported.			</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">AWS IAM Identity Center:</span> Only groups are supported.			</li>
            <li>
			The Wiz detection mechanism for excessive access is based, among other things, on permission usage by target entities. The default excessive access analysis period is 90 days, effectively creating relevant issues after this time period. If Wiz was deployed in your cloud environment less than 90 days ago, you can reduce this period in order to generate relevant issues. For details on how to shorten this time period to as little as seven days, see the <a href="http://docs.wiz.io/">Wiz documentation</a>.	</li>

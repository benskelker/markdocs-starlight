# Integrate Remote Access for AWS environments

This topic describes how to integrate and , so that policies can be
applied to vendors that need to access AWS cloud environments.

## Overview

Organizations that use to give vendors access to web apps in the user
portal space can integrate and , and then create applicable policies to
enforce zero standing access for these vendors.

When policies are created for vendors, they can authenticate to as
usual, and select the required AWSÂ web app from the user portal space.

To integrate the services, complete the following steps:

1.  Configure the Identity SSO settings in
    \[%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%\]

2.  Create a dedicated role in the \[%=cc_product_vars.SCA-short%\]
    tenant

3.  Invite the vendors in \[%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%\]

4.  Configure the \[%=cc_product_vars.SCA-short%\] policy

## Before you begin

The AWS web app in the user portal space (in the tenant) must be
configured to use provisioning.

## []{#Configur}Configure the Identity SSO settings in {#configure-the-identity-sso-settings-in .step madcap:autonum="Step 1: "}

You must configure to communicate with when a vendor accesses a web app
from the user portal space. This configuration is done in the SSO
functionality.

For information about how to configure the SSO settings, see the
[docs](/remote-access-standard/latest/en/content/admin/settings-idaptive.htm){alt="Link to [%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%] topic about configuring [%=cc_product_vars.IdentityAdmin-full% SSO settings]"}.

## []{#Set}Create a dedicated role in the tenant {#create-a-dedicated-role-in-the-tenant .step madcap:autonum="Step 2: "}

You must create a dedicated role in the instance of the tenant that can
use to identify your vendors and apply the relevant policies.

After this role is created, use it when inviting any vendor that should
be included in an policy.

For information about how to create a role, see the
[docs](/identity-administration/latest/en/content/coreservices/getstarted/userrolesassign.htm?tocpath=Add%20system%20users%20and%20roles%7CAssign%20users%20to%20roles%20and%20manage%20roles%7C_____0#Createanewrole){target="_blank"
alt="Link to heading on how to create a new role in [%=cc_product_vars.IdentityAdmin-full%] docs"}.

## []{#Invite}Invite the vendors in {#invite-the-vendors-in .step madcap:autonum="Step 3: "}

When you invite vendors in , you have to configure several parameters to
enable to identify the vendor and apply the relevant policy.

1.  In the [Allowed applications ]{.Emphasis}area, select the [Allow
    access to Identity web applications ]{.Emphasis}option.

2.  in the [User provisioning ]{.Emphasis}area, do the following:

    1.  Select the [ will create and manage the user]{.Emphasis} option.

    2.  In the [Role ]{.Emphasis}field, specify the dedicated role that
        you created for this purpose.

For more information about inviting vendors, see the
[\[%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%\]
docs](/remote-access-standard/latest/en/content/admin/invitevendors.htm "Link to topic in [%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%] on how to invite vendors"){target="_blank"
alt="Link to topic in [%=cc_product_vars.RemoteAccess-short%] on how to invite vendors"}.

## []{#Configur2}Configure the policy {#configure-the-policy .step madcap:autonum="Step 4: "}

When you configure an policy to include vendors, ensure that you select
the dedicated role that you created in when you add identities to the
policy. uses this role to identify the vendor so it can apply the
policy.

For more information about creating policies, see Create an AWS policy.

::: note
You can only create policies for vendors that have been invited to .

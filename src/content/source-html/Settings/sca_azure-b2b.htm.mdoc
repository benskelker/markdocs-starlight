# Integrate Microsoft Entra B2B

Organizations using Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration can seamlessly
integrate external user accounts into the . This integration enables
external users to retain their existing email addresses, regardless of
the domain they belong to, making collaboration simpler and more secure.

## Prerequisites

This integration relies on the following initial administrative setup,
which needs to be done once only:

- The SCA - Microsoft Entra B2B integration must be enabled in your
  tenant. For details, see Configure general
  \[%=cc_product_vars.SCA-short%\] settings.

- Microsoft Entra B2B user accounts have been:

  1.  Provisioned to the Cloud Directory, as described in [Provision
      Microsoft Entra ID users to the CyberArk Cloud Directory with
      SCIM](/identity-administration/latest/en/content/coreservices/usersroles/scim-aad.htm).

  2.  Authenticated to , as described in [Federate with Microsoft Entra
      ID using
      SAML](/identity-administration/latest/en/content/coreservices/usersroles/partnerazure.htm).

## Set up account mapping

To enable Microsoft Entra B2B users to access the console from the
platform, they need an access point from , also called a web app. Create
the web app with the following account mapping settings:

1.  Create the web app as described in Create a web app for
    \[%=cv-shared-variables.entra-id-long%\].

2.  From the , select .

3.  Go to [Apps & Widgets \> Web Apps]{.Emphasis} and select the web app
    you just created.

4.  In the [Account Mapping]{.Emphasis} settings:

    1.  Select [Directory Service Field]{.Emphasis}.

    2.  In the [Directory Service field name]{.Emphasis} field, enter
        [mail]{.Emphasis}.

## Example use case scenario

Partner 1 (jond@partner1.com) is federated into Microsoft Entra ID
through B2B collaboration. Partner 1\'s email address remains unchanged
in Entra ID, ensuring consistency and familiarity for the user. When
provisioning this user account into using SCIM, Partner 1 is represented
by the same email address (jond@partner1.com). This streamlined process
allows CyberArk to map and manage Entra B2B user accounts efficiently.

The integration uses SCIM provisioning for user and group
synchronization and SAML authentication for secure access, enabling a
cohesive experience for external partners.

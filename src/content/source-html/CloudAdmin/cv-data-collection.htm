        <h1>Data collection</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.CV-full" /> collects data from different data sources for which it was granted permission during the onboarding process, making the appropriate API calls to your connected cloud environments according to the relevant data it needs to fetch.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>You can control which workspaces <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.CV-full" /> scans. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="cv-connect-workspaces.htm">Manage a workspace connection</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When <MadCap:variable name="cc_product_vars.CV-full" /> scans your cloud environments, it collects the following data for each connected workspace:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Identities </span>and the associated metadata of identities that potentially can interact with each connected workspace. </p>

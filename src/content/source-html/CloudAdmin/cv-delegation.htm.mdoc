# Manage workspace delegation

This topic explains workspace delegation, the privileges that are
assigned to delegates for the workspaces that they manage, and how cloud
security administrators can assign and remove delegates to/from
workspaces in the cloud environment.

## Workspace delegation

The cloud security administrator can delegate management of single or
multiple cloud workspaces to other administrators in the organization.

[Workspace delegates]{.Emphasis} can create, edit, and delete policies
for identities associated with their workspaces from the UI or using the
public APIs.

In addition, workspace delegates can manage on-demand access requests
from identities that want to access the workspace, and can manually
approve or reject these requests.

The[ Workspace delegation]{.Emphasis} page displays the following
information:

  Item                          Description
  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [Workspace]{.Emphasis}        The name of the workspace as it appears in the cloud provider
  [Workspace type]{.Emphasis}   The cloud provider and type of workspace, for example a Google Cloud project or an Azure directory or subscription
  [Delegates]{.Emphasis}        The identities that have been assigned to manage the workspace
